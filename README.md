## Portfolio Optimization Application
#### This application uses Modern Portfolio Theory or the Markowitz Optimization Model to find the optimal allocation weights for a given portfolio, with maximized Sharpe ratio and minimized variance. 
#### The prediction model uses an XGBoost regressor to predict next month's log returns. The prediction is made to increase accuracy for the our optimal portfolio allocation weights.
